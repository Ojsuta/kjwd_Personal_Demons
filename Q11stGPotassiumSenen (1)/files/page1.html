            <li style = "color: #541010;">And so, he ran, with his small limbs and his tiny figure, his shoes digging into the dirt, making him slip and catch himself—his hands—upon tree bark, creating yet new callouses for him to remember.
            <br><br>
            He <i>would</i> forget this, though: he knew that.
            <br><br>
            What he wouldn't forget was his brother's sin against him. Weren't siblings supposed to be all lovely and caring? Why was Pho—no, <i>Phobetor</i>, so mean?
            <br>
            They were both kids! Children didn't carry such crimes!
            <br><br>
            Hence, with tears, he kneeled down onto the ground.
            <br><br>
            O', beloved innocence, where had you gone? To abandon a youth of your following to the treaches of his own impure brother? To leave him with naught a horn? To fall to his knees with tears in one eye—tears in his other eye <i>socket</i>?
            <br><br>
            What would his mommy and daddy say once he got home? What about at school? The strangers on the street?
            <br><br>
            <i>'Ew, what a freak! So... different—different horns, I yell! what a blasphemy to the demon race!'</i>
            <br><br>
            Pyralis already started crying at the sheer possibility, bringing his legs up to his chest and burying his face into his knees.
            <br><br>
            Then, footsteps. Cheery, optimistic: Lords! Was that Phobetor?
            <br><br>
            "She'll never catch me..." was the cheeky voice.
            <br><br>
            A voice that wasn't his brother's.
            <br><br>
            He looked up, swallowing hard as he realized that he was making eye contact with a complete stranger. His lips trembled, and one of his hands shot up to cover the remains of his right horn, his other hand wiping away the blemishes of despair on his face.
            <br><br>
            Was this it? his worst fear? The judgment for a mistake not of his own doing? Was this his <i>un</i>doing?
            <br><br>
            The trees felt as if they were closing in.
            <br><br>
            "...are you playing hide and seek, too?" the other boy asked innocently—<i>gently</i>? Pyralis hadn't heard that in a while...—slowly crouching down before... crawling? Short-leggedly walking? Towards Pyralis.
            <br><br>
            He shook his head at the question.
            <br><br>
            His fellow, for some unforeseen reason, giggled. "Don't worry, bud-bud! Your secret's safe with me. They'll never find you." A grin. "Because I'm here!"
            <br>
            There was a sort of softness in those purple eyes that made Pyralis tilt his head in acceptance of this... other demon.
            <br><br>
            "Are you dizzy?" he asked while eyeing Pyralis'... horn.
            <br><br>
            Pyralis froze, his voice catching in his throat. At that moment, he found himself stuck in his own body—acting as nothing more than an observer, only able to watch the scene, as his thoughts came to a terrifying standstill.
            <br>
            Sweat rolled down his neck, and his eye fleeted about before settling onto the sharp grass. His ears rung, and it took several long seconds just to make one quick gesture: he pinched together the thumb and pointer of his trembling hand.
            <br>
            But of course, his other grasp remained around his poor horn.
            <br><br>
            The boy stared at Pyralis like the latter was an interesting animal. Sure, there was always the chance that it was simple and pure curiosity, but when had Pyralis ever received the gift of that?
            <br><br>
            "Only little? That's good!" He reached out, carefully brushing his knuckles against the stray blood on Pyralis' forehead. "Can you speak?"
            <br><br>
            Pyralis stared blankly, and <i>that</i> was when his throat felt dry. By the Lords! Had he just eaten the playbox sand?
            <br>
            He slowly covered his heart with both of his hands, pressing against himself to soothe his own chest—hoping to the god he didn't believe in that once, <i>just this once</i>, he could say something to someone that wasn't his mommy or daddy.
            <br><br>
            However, he could only shyly shake his head.
            <br><br>
            "That's cool!" the boy cheered, discreetly, or at least, that's what Pyralis thought he was trying to be, getting closer to peep at Pyralis' horn and eye. "I'm Kareem."
            <br>
            Then, this <i>'Kareem'</i> narrowed his eyes in thought.
            <br><br>
            Pyralis found his hands slowly falling to his sides, trusting his heart to heal on its own.
            <br><br>
            "Er... what about this: how old are you?"
            <br><br>
            Pyralis held up one full hand and the pointer on his other.
            <br><br>
            "I'm seven!" Kareem giggled. "That means I'm taller than you," he teased.
            <br><br>
            Never had Pyralis so awfully—<i>playfully</i>—wanted a growth spurt.</li>

      </header>
        <ul>
            <li style = "color: #541010;">
            It felt like his world was crumbling in on itself—the only problem? It was the very world he was trying to build. 
            <br><br>
            Keyword: <i>try.</i> 
            <br><br>
            This far in, and Pyralis, only now realized, far too late, just how much regret and hurt this endeavor of a campaign already had and was going to bring him. And it was to be served on a bony platter made of his own weary body. 
            <br>
            Screaming muscles and wailing bones: The man was <i>this</i> close to ending his reign before it even started. 
            <br><br>
            In a room full of his loves: the piano he sat in front of, the bed he would rest on, the window that allowed in the light of inspiration for his poems (and the dim glow that brought about his cruelest thoughts, such as on a night like this), the paintings in which he found both his solace and his truths in, and, of course, he shan't ever forget: the confidant that sat next to him—all such dears so close to his heart that it hurt, were not, however, even near enough to rid of his doubts. 
            <br><br>
            “Don't give up,” he heard a frustrated voice say, “you've already gotten this far! C'mon,” and the man’s voice became a comforting whisper, “Pyra, I'll push you to the finish line if I have to.” 
            <br><br>
            And those firm, warm arms wrapped around his still figure 
            <br><br>
            “Kareem, be honest, I wouldn't get that far,” Pyralis mumbled. 
            <br><br>  
            “You will. I believe in you.” 
            <br><br>
            “Well, I don’t believe in myself.” 
            <br><br>
            When he finally looked up from his pit of despair, more commonly known as having his eyes closed, it was to see Kareem looking like he'd just been slapped in the face, which didn't even make sense! Why did that man make such an expression? Was Kareem hurt in Pyralis' place? Nonsense! ...surely. 
            <br><br>
            Yet that friend of his seemed so sincere that Pyralis could not help but feel a deep sense of shame take root into his own systems. 
            <br><br>
            “Pyra! Do not say that. How else will you become king?” 
            <br><br>
            When Pyralis didn’t answer, Kareem continued with a sigh: 
            <br><br>
            “Your people have to believe in you. How can they do that if you yourself don't? Remind me, Pyra: the last king of Pirien—the one before the queen—how did that man die? Oh, never mind.  
            <br><br>
            “<i>Why</i> did that man die?” 
            <br><br>
            Pyralis looked at Kareem, trapped in a once-comforting hug, for, right now, the embrace was more akin to a chokehold. Not physically, of course, but mentally. Was the feeling of such a delusional thing only on Pyralis' part? One-hundred percent. No doubt about that. 
            <br><br>
            “Due to a jacquerie. No need for a history lesson, Kareem.” 
            <br><br>
            “It's not a history lesson, Pyra! I'm just trying to prove a point.” 
            <br><br>
            The two shifted around one another, one trying to get a more soothing hold on his friend, and the other trying to discreetly escape this nerve-wracking situation. Could he be blamed, though? All of his fears were presenting themselves to him in, far-too-easy-to-understand word form. And the worst part?— they were being ungraciously unraveled by his best friend. 
            <br><br>
            “Okay, fine. That sounded rude,” Kareem admitted, despite the fact that Pyralis hadn't even realized what <i>‘rudeness'</i> the other could be signifying to. 
            <br><br>
            “What I meant to say was: I feel like you need to understand, actually, <i>re-understand</i> what you are doing this all for. <i>Who</i> you are doing all this for, and... <i>why.</i>” A pause as his tone shifted, “Really, <i>bud</i>? Do you actually expect me to believe that you want to be king just to die because of some uprising?” 
            <br><br>
            Pyralis stared. 
            <br> 
            “Kareem, what in the three realms do you even expect me to utter after those words?” 
            <br><br>
            “You don't need to say anything.” Kareem loosened his grip so they were in a side-hug. Which happened to be the worst time, actually: Pyralis had begun to enjoy the other's… ahem, cuddling. “You just need to understand,” he added. 
            <br><br>
            “Ah, understand? Is that all, Kareem? I understand, alright—that you actually, somehow, had come into the possession of wisdom. Since when did that happen?” 
            <br><br>
            The aforementioned hit Pyralis square in the back of the head. He yelped. 
            <br><br>
            “Oh, beasts—I didn't mean for it to actually hurt!” 
            <br><br>
            “…it's fine.” 
            <br><br>
            Kareem <i>gently</i> patted his friend's head. “So… answer me. Please,” he said as an afterthought. 
            <br><br>
            “Answer what?” 
            <br><br>
            “Oh, don't play dumb, Pyra,” a roll of his eyes. 
            <br><br>
            Pyralis groaned as he officially turned his body away from the other. Kareem audibly gasped. 
            <br><br>
            “Alright, then, I won't play dumb. …and I <i>won't</i> let you hug me anymore.” 
            <br><br>
            Kareem, much like Pyralis, was having difficulty containing his amusement. “Fine, you ungrateful little thing—" 
            <br><br>
            “<i>—little?</i>” 
            <br><br>
            For a moment (just a moment!), Pyralis was tempted to stand up and show off his inch-taller height, when he realized that the other was just joking around. Ah, at the very least, Pyralis caught himself before he made a big deal over nothing again. He was a piece of— last time it occurred. 
            <br><br>
            Kareem raised an eyebrow, and Pyralis knew his time to stall was up. 
            <br><br>
            “Well, Kareem, I'm doing this for you.” 
            <br>
            The aforementioned let out a half-huff, half-chuckle. 
            <br>
            “For you, the people. I mean—I’ve seen all those psychopaths crowd in front of my house just to try and convince me to run for king. It's really just for your, <i>their</i>, sakes, honestly. I truly wish not to have hundreds of demons near-raid my house again… and all for such a… strange? Reason.” 
            <br><br>
            He gulped. If he were to be even more honest: Pyralis had no clue what to feel about his own campaign. Hence, duh, he had spoken in a more-or-less neutral manner. 
            <br>
            His best friend, however, seemed to know Pyralis' emotions more than the man himself did: Kareem's eyes had widened in some sort of realization. 
            <br><br>
            Speaking of which, Pyralis turned back around so they were talking properly to one another. 
            <br><br>
            “Pyra?” He questioned, sounding astonished—though, without the smile. 
            <br><br>
            “Er… what?” 
            <br><br>
            “Do you even want to be king?” 
            <br><br>
            “Of course I do!” 
            <br><br>
            Kareem shook his head, Pyralis was more or less offended. Was his closest friend, the man he had known for almost two decades, fond of since the dawn of their existence, doubting Pyralis' own will to become king? 
            <br>
            No… N—no way! There had to be some sort of mistake. Perhaps Pyralis had spoken the wrong thing aloud and had yet to realize it? It had happened before. 
            <br><br>
            “But, Pyra—” 
            <br><br>
            “—Kareem! After all I've done, do you truly believe I'm doing this not of my own accord? I may act stupid, but I am no fool for something as vital as this. This is what an entire <i>kingdom</i> depends on. What <i>I</i> depend on! Giving up now would be brainless—" 
            <br><br>
            “—Pyra, bud, there's time. There are months left before the election. You can still back out.” 
            <br><br>
            Pyralis stood up and turned away, pacing the room as it became harder and harder to face the other. 
            <br><br>
            What kind of affection, or— <i>hate</i> was this? Had Kareem not, just moments ago, been trying to get Pyralis to the finish line? 
            <br>
            Ah, but of course: was it not a more genuine care to take into consideration what Pyralis actually wanted? 
            <br><br>
            <i>(What did he want?) </i>
            <br><br>
            “Well, I have invested the same number of months into this. Time, money, relations I could have <i>actually kept</i> if it weren't for this stupid campaign! Kareem,” voice desperate as he plummeted into the dark depths of his bed, 
            <br>
            “if I don't win, I will lose everything instead. I, I thought it wasn't going to be that big a deal! But… now I'm bloody trapped in a prison I've made for myself.” 
            <br><br>
            He sat up, staring wide-eyed at his friend. Help, o', help! What was he to do if not ponder upon his sorrows and regrets? To claim victory was to surrender all; to surrender all was to claim victory.
