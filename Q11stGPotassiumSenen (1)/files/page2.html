          <ul>
            <li style = "color: #45124d;">“Pyralis Fayer? You can come in now,” the nice lady said.
            <br><br>
            Kareem tugged at Pyra’s hand before standing up, making his way to the door with Pyra right behind him. The nice lady raised an eyebrow. “Hello, boys. Where are your parents?”
            <br><br>
            “I’m here because I wanna hang out!” Kareem chirped.
            <br><br>
            ‘Busy.’
            <br><br>
            “He said his parents are busy,” he interpreted. Then, he glanced down at Pyralis’ hands, realizing what the other boy wanted to add. Looking back up, Kareem said, “but don’t worry, he’s got money.”
            <br><br>
            After a sigh of relief, the nice lady let the two boys in.
            <br><br>
            ‘My parents sent them a letter,’ Pyra whispered to Kareem bitterly.
            <br><br>
            Kareem laughed. “Maybe they forgot. The people here are old, after all,” he replied, taking one of the two seats in front of a doctor. Pyra sat across from Kareem.
            <br><br>
            “Ah, Pyralis. It’s good to see you again,” the doctor said. 
            <br><br>
            Pyra shifted uncomfortably.
            <br><br>
            The doctor took a clipboard from the desk as she glanced at Pyra before signalling that the lady from earlier could go. The latter nodded, stepping back outside after closing the door.
            <br><br>
            “Since your parents aren’t here, I’ll just be taking some measurements.” She stood up, walking around the desk to reach Pyra. “I’ll be just like last time. We'll be putting some putty on the horn,” As she gently poked Pyra’s horn. He flinched.
            <br><br>
            “Please don’t do that,” Kareem said.
            <br><br>
            She seemed surprised before brushing it off, pulling her hand back and smiling. “But this time, I’ll need to measure your other horn, too.” She bent down, making eye contact with Pyra in spite of his blindfold. “Since you’re still a growing boy, your horn has been getting bigger, too. Does that make sense?”
            <br><br>
            Pyralis nodded, scooching away from her.
            <br><br>
            “Do his wings grow?” Kareem couldn’t help but ask.
            <br><br>
            The doctor stood upright, turning to Kareem with an amused expression. “Of course. You’re Pyralis’ friend, aren’t you? Both of your wings are growing, just like your horns.”
            <br><br>
            “When do they stop?”
            <br><br>
            “After you reach puberty.”
            <br><br>
            Kareem tilted his head. “What’s that, again? My mama keeps telling me, but I keep forgetting!”
            <br><br>
            He found it cute how Pyra mirrored him, tilting his head to the side. Kareem giggled to himself.
            <br><br>
            “It means you’re getting older. You’d get pimples, body odour, body hair, bigger wings, bigger horns… sometimes, you’d even get rebellious.”
            <br><br>
            “That doesn’t sound nice.” Kareem frowned.
            <br><br>
            “There are upsides, too. But your parents will tell you that. Now, Pyralis–” She turned back around, startling poor Pyra. “What color would you like your horn to be?”
            <br><br>
            Neither Kareem nor Pyra were ready for that question.
             <br><br>
            But Kareem was quite ecstatic about it. “Ooo~ try purple, Pyra!”
             <br><br>
            Pyra stared.
             <br><br>
            “What about red? You like that, right?” Kareem continued, grinning at his friend. Meanwhile, the doctor chuckled as she went away, presumably to grab some measuring things.
             <br><br>
            “Hmm… you remember color theory in class? What about green? That’s red’s complementary! Oh, wait… does that mean you hate it?”
             <br><br>
            Pyra stared. And was breathing… heavily.
             <br><br>
            “Pyra?” Kareem frowned, squeaking his chair closer.
             <br><br>
            ‘...am I bad?’ was what Kareem understood from Pyra’s sign.
             <br><br>
            “What do you mean?”
             <br><br>
            ‘Because I don’t want a different color.’
             <br><br>
            Kareem blinked before giggling. “Okay, okay! Doctor, doctaaah! Pyra wants to be all-natural, please,” he announced as if the doctor wasn’t already walking back towards them.
             <br><br>
            “Good choice, Pyralis,” she said.
             <br><br>
            Kareem grinned. “Yes. Good choice!” he basically teased, attempting to lighten Pyra’s mood and ease his breathing.
             <br><br>
            Pyra smiled softly, and much to the doctor’s, and a bit of Kareem’s shock–”Thank you,” he whispered with his voice.
             <br><br>
            Oh, how Kareem’s heart filled at that! Those words, those two quiet yet spoken words, made him keep smiling and smiling like nothing else could have made him happier. 
            <br>
            His friend was using Sign just a little less often now. That meant Pyra was getting just a little more comfortable with speaking. That was good, yes?
            <br><br>
            Yes, of course, it was good! Yipee!
            <br><br>
            It just… just made Kareem way too proud.

            Fire?
            <br><br>
            FIRE?
            <br><br>
            FIRE!!!
            <br><br>
            Screaming and shouting echoed from right outside on the main street, and even from the stage itself. Kareem and Pyra were waiting behind the curtains, initially queuing up for Pyra's turn to speak for his campaign, yet now...
            <br><br>
            "What's happening?" Kareem whispered, eyeing the smoke from behind the waiting curtain. "Qadira mentioned she'll be putting on a show, yes?"
            <br><br>
            "There's <i>smoke</i>, Kareem. I believe not that she, or any other candidate, would willingly add fire to their campaign."
            <br><br>
            "You do."
            <br><br>
            "I'm a mage."
            <br><br>
            "Fine..." Kareem sighed, blinking the exhaustion away from his eyes before smiling at Pyra, poking the man's eyebags. He received a huff from his friend.
            <br>
            They walked past the other apprehensive candidates—those who were popular, evil, good, and the jokesters—before stepping outside onto the stage, much to the surprise of those queuers.
            <br><br>
            "Am I seeing things?" Pyra asked.
            <br><br>
            "They don't know <i>'stop, drop, and roll'</i>."
            <br><br>
            The shock from the mere sight of things made both of them feel just a little numb.
            <br><br>
            Then, by some miracle, Kareem was finally beginning to feel his blood travel through his veins and arteries, giving him a clearer mind, sight, and even hearing!
            <br><br>
            Adrenaline, thank you.
            <br><br>
            His eyes darted about, landing upon the burnt oak of the stage—onto the crackling, hissing, roaring tongues of scarlet—and, at last, onto the victims of those burning chains' wrath, even their chairs were swallowed up.
            <br><br>
            But it had been all to deliberate.
            <br><br>
            "Their namesake doesn't fail them," Pyra said, both his and Kareem's gaze landing upon the retreating figures of faux knight armor.
            <br><br>
            And then, the two of them ran.
            <br><br>
            "Excuse me—" Kareem stopped himself, realizing that these patients wouldn't be listening. "Can everyone else with an injury please gather into one place? For monitoring." A deep breath as he prepared to yell again, "Is anyone else here a doctor?!"
            <br><br>
            Some people, out of their desperation, did manage to oblige to his commands, sitting together—some five or ten people—on the concrete, looking up at Kareem with burns on their arms or legs.
            <br><br>
            He turned to his side, talking to Pyra...
            <br><br>
            ...magic was amazing.
            <br><br>
            The mage had already begun to use his apparatus, his own body, channeling his magic through his limbs in time with his breaths, lips trembling before he commanded the flames with just his steady boots and trained gloves, the embers flying up to become one with the air.
            <br><br>
            Pyra had been quick, precise, and straight to the point.
            <br>
            And so <i>perfect</i>... 
            <br><br>
            ...for king, that was.
            <br><br>
            "Kareem, can you handle them?" he asked, catching his breath as he dragged his feet to near the ablaze stage, his hands shaking with exhaustion. "I need to take care of this."
            <br><br>
            "Yes, of course," Kareem answered, watching his friend with narrowed eyes before sprinting over to the more severe burn patients. "Can anyone help me lift them up?"
            <br><br>
            As he spoke, he approached one of the unconscious bodies, wrapping his arms underneath the figure and laying them down onto the ground.
            He inhaled sharply, realizing he couldn't even tell if this was a man or a woman.
            <br><br>
            "Are emergency services here yet?!" he yelled out to the terrified masses—the minorly injured tending to each other, thankfully—which wasn't that many, considering that several had run away. Which made sense, of course.
            <br><br>
            "They've being held up by a fire at third street for the last half an hour," some woman said, going towards where Kareem was and helping to lay another person onto the ground.
            <br><br>
            Oh, dear, it really was intentional.
            <br><br>
            "The next king or queen's really gotta up their funding," another demon said, helping to lay a casualty onto the ground.
            <br><br>
            Soon, other people were gathering and following Kareem's lead—shifting the burn victim's bodies properly so each could be inspected.
            <br><br>
            "I know CPR!" some demons said.
            <br><br>
            Kareem, already on his knees and counting each compression, nodded. "Go on, then. Thank you."
            <br><br>
            "I can take over," a man told him.
            <br><br>
            He smiled gently, standing up rather quickly so the gentleman could ease away Kareem's looming weariness. Then, he looked up, seeing a certain demon approaching.
            <br><br>
            "Pyra! Are you okay?"
            <br><br>
            "...just..." A gasp for breath. "...tired."
            <br><br>
            "Rest."
            <br><br>
            "No. What else can I do?"
            <br><br>
            "Sit down?"
            <br><br>
            "I'm serious."
            <br><br>
            A pause before Kareem gave in. "Blankets, gauze: I don't know how you'll get them, but we need them," he said hesitantly.
            <br><br>
            Pyra nodded.
            <br><br>
            That gave Kareem the cue to bend back down taking out his apparatus—a notebook—to focus his magic into it... willing the elements to follow his kind will and, with a sharp clasp of his hands, start back up a patient's heart.
            <br><br>
            He could feel himself strain, as if the walls of the organ were hard and stiff, forcing Kareem to time his breaths and gestures just right, so he wouldn't accidentally let go prematurely, or even make the heart into a bomb.
            <br>
            He clenched his fist once, twice, thrice... and then, the person doing CPR stopped.
            <br><br>
            Kareem acted as the casualty's heart a few more times before letting go of both his breath and magic, glancing down upon his patient.
            <br><br>
            "They're breathing—heart! Their heart is beating!" the man was amazed.
            <br><br>
            "That's the bare minimum," Kareem muttered bitterly, but—hopefully.
            <br><br>
            "Where are the casualties?!" a voice boomed, and Kareem's head snapped towards the source.
            <br><br>
            "Oh, thank God! They're here! All gathered!" he yelled out, feeling tears of joy prick at his eyes.
            <br><br>
            The emergency services took far too long.
            <br><br>
            At least they arrived at all.
            <br><br>
            Kareem took several long moments just to catch his breath, hands clasped over his mouth, eyes closed, ears mixing in sounds with voices, yells with whispers.
            <br><br>
            "Gauze," Pyra said, making Kareem look to his side.
            <br><br>
            Kareem smiled. "Nice, thanks—where's your jacket?"
            <br><br>
            "Turned into the gauze."
            <br><br>
            "Oh." He chuckled before waving his tired friend off, standing up to approach a patient who had yet to receive extensive medical attention due to how little the doctors were, and how many the casualties were.
            <br><br>
            Kareem couldn't bring himself to make those odds worse.
            <br><br>
            "Hello," he greeted, bending down to the other's level. "I'll be putting pressure, okay? Then I'll add the gauze."
            <br><br>
            "I don't feel anything."
            <br><br>
            Kareem sighed before trying to put on a reassuring smile. "Some burns can do that."
            <br><br>
            This was the worst campaign day ever.</li>

      </header>
        <ul>
            <li style = "color: #45124d;">Kareem had failed in every aspect possible.
            <br><br>
            Not only as a doctor. Not just as the king’s Royal Physician— but as a friend. Pyra’s supposed best friend.
            <br><br>
            How could he have not noticed the signs?<i>‘Oh, you’ve just got a tummy ache,’</i>  in the first two hours.
            <br>
            <i>‘You just ate something bad. Take a nap,’</i> he had said in the next six hours.
            <br><br>
            Gods, could anyone else have known? The absolute fear? Terror? The tears he’d immediately shed once he realized that, by some chance, Pyra may not awaken again? What of the sigh of relief he released once his king came around?
            <br><br>
            And of the claws that gripped his heart when Pyra ran into the bathroom to vomit out his insides?
            <br><br>
            Even now, as he sat in front of the clinic bed, did his breath catch in his throat—refusing to let go, punishing him for his negligence, halting him from taking another gulp of the institution’s stagnant air that he was not even close to deserving of.
            <br><br>
            Kareem had been here for six hours, and not any one of his fellow doctors’ nor nurses’ prodding could get him to leave at this time of dawn. His head hung low, yet his hand was steady on Pyra’s upper arm.
            <br><br>
            <i>If</i> Pyra woke up, and that was a horrifyingly large <i>‘if’</i>, how would Kareem break the news? The truth of what poisoned the great King of Pirien? The effects of it? 
            <br>
            How would Kareem break… 
            <br><br>
            …Pyra’s heart?
            <br><br>
            Would it break his mind, too?
            <br><br>
            “...Kareem?”
            <br><br>
            The aforementioned’s head shot up as he shifted his chair closer, putting his hand upon his friend’s cheek. He smiled softly, ignoring the way it made his eyes even heavier.
            <br><br>
            “Yes, Pyra?”
            <br><br>
            “Where am I?”
            <br><br>
            <i>‘Right here. With me. Right where you should be!’</i>
            <br><br>
            “The Royal Clinic,” he answered, pressing the back of his hand against Pyra’s neck to check for his temperature. Instead, the king coughed, and Kareem chuckled. “How do you feel?”
            <br><br>
            “Dead,” Pyra answered, though not without a hint of a smile.
            <br><br>
            Was now the right time? To tear off the bandage before either one of them could even begin to register the pain? To show off what a failure Kareem had become—so much so that he hadn’t even been able to keep the one thing that Pyra valued? The man’s whole life? Works? Those papers, essays, and theories—all based around <i>magic</i>?
            <br><br>
            “And you?” Pyra asked through the silence.
            <br><br>
            “You can cry,” Kareem whispered, his smile faltering. The other’s blindfold wrinkled as his eyebrows furrowed. “And you can shout at me.”
            <br><br>
            “...why?”
            <br><br>
            “Won’t you ask why you’re here, instead?”
            <br><br>
            “...”
            <br><br>
            “You were poisoned, Pyra.” Kareem closed his eyes and grit his teeth. “It was a special kind of poison, developed all the way in Kortel for tactical warfare.”
            <br><br>
            “Kareem.”
            <br><br>
            “Yes?” He opened his eyes.
            <br><br>
            And that was when he realized that Pyra had been moving his arms and hands, staring at them blankly, lips parted, blindfold wet.
            <br><br>
            “What happened to my magic?”
