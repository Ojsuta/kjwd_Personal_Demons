      <header>
        <h3 style = "color: #271a03;" title = "Childhood story.">Hell's Light (is Gone).</h3>
      </header>

          <ul>
            <li style = "color: #503d0f;">Boredom in the bedroom was no good thing for a kid. Especially not when he didn’t have many friends, and especially-especially not when his only friends were downstairs—in the club—having fun without him! Gah, the music was too loud and too envying…
            <br><br>
            And it didn’t help that he missed his maman.
            <br><br>
            The door opened, and he shot up to his feet, in a fighting stance—before he realized it was his papa and a small… thing.
            <br><br>
            “Ew. He has no hair.”
            <br><br>
            “That’s your little brother, Sol,” papa said, cradling the tiny creature in his arms.
            <br><br>
            “Where’s maman? I wanna go to the library,” Soleil replied, poking the weak infant in his father’s arms.
            <br><br>
            “She’s busy,” he said gently.
            <br><br>
            “Does it have a name?”
            <br><br>  
            “Not <i>'it'</i>, Sol. He’s a <i>'he'</i>.”
            <br><br>
            “Either way, bring me to the library,” he huffed, sitting down onto his bed. “You won’t let me go to the club, and I’ve read everything in my room!”
            <br><br>
            “Now, now, Sol, no shouting,” his papa reprimanded, cooing at the infant as it wailed out at the mere sound of his brother’s voice. Soleil crossed his arms. “His name is Orion.”
            <br><br>
            “Why does he get the cooler name?”
            <br><br>
            “You both have equally cool names.”
            <br><br>
            “Why did you and maman decide to have sex eight years after I was born?”
            <br><br>
            His papa turned slack-jawed, staring down at Soleil with wide eyes. “Sol! Where’d you learn that?”
            <br><br>
            “You own a club,” he said, his tongue sticking out. Soleil reached up to grab a book from his bedside table. “Look at this! It’s overdue! Bring me to the library <i>and</i> give me money.”
            <br><br>
            Papa frowned before turning away, holding Orion tight. Soleil couldn't understand the emotions in his eyes, nor the way his lips pursed. It was like anger and disappointment— but at himself. “Think about what you’ve said, Sol, and the way you said them.”
            <br><br>
            Soleil didn't want to, rather, “I wanna see maman!” he whined, slamming the book onto the floor. “Where is she?! I haven’t seen her in a month! Papa, <i>papa—!</i>”
            <br><br>
            The door shut loudly, and Soleil was left alone.
            <br><br>  
            He could hear Orion’s loud crying.
            <br><br>
            And, for some reason, he thought that the infant aged a day or two knew more than Soleil.</li>

  <hr style = "height: 4px; visibility: hidden;">

      <header>
        <h3 style = "color: #271a03;" title = "Adulthood; War story.">Hell's Tormentor (is Myself)</h3>
      </header>
        <ul>
            <li style = "color: #503d0f;">“Maybe follow Madam Kanelo’s footsteps,” a soldier sneered as Soleil walked past, arms in his front, head held up high.
            <br><br>
            “At least she cared about her brother,” someone else added once Soleil fell into line. “Died for him—you, why couldn’t you do the same?”
            <br><br>
            “Everyone likes Orion,” a demon supplied. “And Chantae.”
            <br><br>
            “I didn’t do anything,” Soleil said through gritted teeth, prepared to say more, but just then, the lieutenant entered through the door, beginning to make his way down the line.
            <br><br>
            Soleil’s mind began to race.
            <br><br>
            Was he going to suffer? Endure even more hurt in addition to his brother’s death? To his wife’s?
            <br>
            And his face… gods, what sort of life was worth living at this point? To serve and to protect—yet he had no one he wanted to diligently do that for.
            <br><br>
            “And what happened, LeBlanc?” the lieutenant questioned, turning to look at Soleil. “I don’t see much of a face left on you. Then again, I wonder how much is left of the other LeBlancs.”
            <br><br>
            Soleil took a deep breath, trying not to wince at the memory… memories of the mirror: of what had occurred.
            <br><br>
            “Where’s your mouth gone?”
            <br><br>
            Sweet bloodied gods.
            <br><br>
            Was this his torture?
            <br><br>
            To forever be reminded? Of his incompetence as a brother? A husband? Of the way his face had been mangled, deformed— not just that, but his neck, shoulder, arm?
            <br>
            Of how <i>it</i> had brutally torn the skin off of his jaw and his lips away from his teeth, making the very act of screaming for help that much more impossible?
            <br><br>  
            The way those tiny fiends gnawed at his skin at every new wound, creating miniscule homes in his flesh, which the medic had to pry out one-by-one, yet with great hesitance, as that medic had known of what Soleil had done?
            <br><br>
            Was he to be eternally tormented by his peers for the fat that had been ripped off from the side of his face, leaving bone bare and exposed? Scarring one of his eyes blind? 
            <br><br>
            And would it be engraved into his eyelids—the scene as he watched his beloved Chantae, brutalized in front of him? He only surviving since she allowed herself to become a sacrifice, the beast only coming after Soleil to fulfill the last of its needs?
            <br><br>  
            “Won’t even speak,” the lieutenant spat.
            <br><br>
            Soleil should have taken his brother’s demise as a cautionary tale: his sudden disappearance once he entered the desert should have meant something to Soleil.
            <br><br> 
            But no, mere days after, he’d invited Chantae to a shed nearby for some alone time.
            <br><br> 
            If he’d never loved her, then she would have survived.
            <br><br> 
            And if he’d loved his brother just a bit more, then Soleil would have gotten that warning.</li>

            <li style = "color: #503d0f;">“I would have understood if it was the kid—but he actually did the best!” Soleil roared, his voice echoing in his helmet and hitting off of the walls, making a deafening mixture.
            <br><br>
            The other demons, clad in armor from head to toe, shifted uncomfortably, whispering amongst themselves.
            <br><br>
            “No answer?!” He groaned, unsheathing his sword.
            <br><br>
            Everyone else in the room froze.
            <br><br>
            “You,” he pointed the blade at Nuage. “I said to set Qadira’s dress on fire. Not the stage!” Throwing the sword right into the wall, digging its edge a few inches into the concrete, “And especially not the people!”
            <br><br>
            “Hey, now, she was watching me!” she hissed in response.
            <br><br>
            “Gah, just—shut up.” He took a deep breath, turning to the rest of them. “We don’t want her as queen. We want the people to take our side: <i>not</i> to vote for her! So she'd make a fool out of herself. But guess what? They’ll hate us. How do we get people on the side of rebels they hate?!”
            <br><br>
            “What were the rest of you even doing?” he questioned, marching around the room. “You, answer.”
            <br><br>
            Etoile froze, standing there dumbly.
            <br><br>
            “BY THE LORDS!” Soleil screamed, face-palming himself through his helm.
            <br><br>
            “I was trying to seduce Qarida as a distraction,” Comete said with pride.
            <br><br>
            “Gods, you manwhore. It didn’t even work!”
            <br><br>
            “It did,” Nebuleuse said softly yet firmly. “Just to a small degree.”
            <br><br>
            “Duh, of course! Who wouldn’t get distracted by a man sexually harassing her?!”
            <br><br>
            Were Soleil’s recruits stupid or what?
            <br><br>
            A gasp from Comete. “I was not! You really are vulgar, Sol—”
            <br><br>
            “How many times must I tell you?: NO NAMES!”
            <br><br>
            “They’re code names anyway. You’re just overreacting,” Nuage said, stepping towards Soleil.
            <br><br>
            Soleil was <i>this</i> close to killing one of his fellow rebels. Sure, they thought that they were using code names, but they didn’t realize Soleil’s was real!
            <br><br>
            “We’re training tomorrow,” he snapped, shoving Nuage out of his way as he faced the rest of them. “Be awake by three or no breakfast.”
            <br><br>
            “Well, don’t kill us!” Nuage exasperated, picking herself up from the floor.
            <br><br>
            “Three? C’mon, think this through,” Nebuleuse tried to calm Soleil, gesturing with her hands as if Soleil was some wild animal.
            <br><br>
            “I have,” Soleil breathed out, leaning against the wall. “You fools didn’t. We’re rebranding ourselves in the afternoon.”
            <br><br>
            There was a collective groan from everyone in the room—even the mute Meteore and the passive Galaxi.</li>
